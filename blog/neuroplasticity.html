      <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
      <h2>Understanding how a mindset can shape one's learning path.</h2>

        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>
          Until recently, it was thought that our brain was a fixed or hard
          wired after a certain age and no matter how much you tried you could
          never change your mindset. Latest science revealed that actually that
          was not true, with consistent effort and focus one could completely
          change their way of thinking. Our brain is more like a malleable
          plastic, which could be bend in whatever shape we want. This property
          of the brain is known as Neuroplasticity.

        <p class="question">How does it benefit people in their learning ?</p>
        <p>
          According to decades of research done by Dr Carol Dweck, it was found
          out that if you make people believe that they dont have a fixed
          mindset and they can actually change their mental ability, people are
          more likely to put more efforts into what they are doing. This leads
          them to be more successful in their learning paths and also overall
          more successful in their lives.

        <p class="question">
          How to engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit
          ?
        </p>
        <p>
          According to study done by Kleim and Jones (<cite
            >Kleim, J. A., & Jones, T. A. (2008). Principles of
            experience-dependent neural plasticity: implications for
            rehabilitation after brain damage. Journal of speech, language, and
            hearing research : JSLHR, 51(1), S225â€“S239.
            https://doi.org/10.1044/1092-4388(2008/018)</cite
          >), there are 10 principles of neuroplasticity. I wont go into detail
          of all of them, but I will use some of them to convey my point.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the principles are :</p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 1.7rem" class="bold">Use it or Lose it:</span>
          It is very important to put continuous efforts towards a particular
          skill that you wish to retain, otherwise you start to forget it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 1.7rem" class="bold"
            >Use it and Improve it:</span
          >
          If you wish to learn something new or improve on a particular skill,
          you have to practice that skill and learn it every single day.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-size: 1.7rem" class="bold"
            >Repetition matters:</span
          >
          Last but not the least, the more you repeat any particular skill the
          better you will get at it.
        </p>
        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>
          Growth mindset is a term used to describe a way of thinking when a
          person believes that facing adversities and challenges lead to growth
          of that individual. Growth mindset is relevant because by acquiring
          that mindset, there is no limit to what a person percieves as their
          potential. Only sky is the limit. Often, we limit ourselves by having
          oppposite of Growth mindset, which is a Fixed mindset. With a fixed
          mindset, we try to avoid challenges and like to stay in our comfort
          zone. This leads to stagnation and ultimately downfall.

        <p class="question">
          Integrating growth mindset into my learning journey
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, Integrating growth mindset would be to set aside atleast 2
          hours every day and focus on working on developing new skills and
          improving and polishing my current skills.

        <h2>
          Blending Neuroplasticity and growth mindset with my learning plan and
          strategies
        </h2>
        <p>
          I already apply growth mindset to lot of things that I do as a part of
          my learning journey. Despite that, I still get stuck in that fixed
          mindset where you put yourself into boxes of your percieved limit. My
          plan is to be more open to the idea that there is no limit to what you
          can do and try to have that growth mindset for every aspect of my
          life. I will try to inculcate more tough challenges for myself into my
          learning and really push myself.

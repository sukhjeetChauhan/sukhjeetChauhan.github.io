      <p class="question">
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </p>
      <p>
        The situation where I made a ethical decision was paying a tailor even
        though he thought I had already paid for it. So I went to pick up my
        altered clothing from the tailor and he said it is all good to take as I
        have already paid. I knew I had'nt paid for the service yet. SO I had a
        decision to make. I could just take the clothing without paying him and
        he would never notice or I could pay him for his service, which is the
        right thing to do. So, I paid him for his service and till now I feel
        really good for doing that.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I belong to punjabi culture, which is a state in Northern India. Punjabi
        culture is traditionally a conservative culture. Also, I have studied 12
        years of my early life in a boarding school, where I was exposed to all
        sorts of different cultures of India and also western and liberal
        values. So, I consider my values as mixture of both conservative and
        liberal. In addition to this, my grandfather had huge influence on my
        early life. He was an army man. He really tried to inculcate discipline
        and hardwork into me.

      <p class="question">
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to DOPE test, I am an OWL. I have a mathematical and analytic
        mind. Also, according to VIA report Honesty and Fairness are my top
        traits. I believe I have a good mind set to be successful in this
        learning journey. Looking at everything in an analytical way can help me
        in problem solving skills. Having Honesty as my strengths can help me
        become a good team worker.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </p>
      <p>
        My most prominent limitation is everything related to social skills. I
        lack humor, prefer working alone more and am generally an introvert.
        These will hinder me in bonding with other group members. I am always
        working to improve my social skills.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example that comes to my mind is of my previous job. So, we were a
        team of 5 with one Team leader. For some reason there was some friction
        between the team leader and some of the team members. I had a good
        understanding with the team leader. So I explained to him what the other
        team members expect of him and what are the things that he should avoid
        to build good bond with the other members. I also had a chat with the
        other members and asked them to be little open minded about the team
        leaders working methods. This helped improve the situation to some
        degree. If I were in that situation all over again I would probably have
        a closed group meeting with everyone laying out their probems politely
        face to face. I think this strategy mught be even more effective.

          In the past, there has been lot of discussion regarding difference
          between Emotionional-Intelligence(EQ) and General-Intelligence(IQ).
          More and more people now believe that EQ is far more important than
          IQ. In this article we will discuss in detail about
          Emotionional-Intelligence and difference between EQ and IQ.

        <p class="question">What is Emotional Intelligence?</p>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence refers to a person's ability to perceive,
          control, evaluate, and express emotions. This includes person's
          ability to identify other people's emotions, controlling their own
          emotions and being good with social interactions.
        </p>
        <p class="question">How is EQ different to IQ?</p>
        <p>
          EQ is different from IQ in many different ways. EQ is used to measure
          emotional competency of a person while IQ is used to measure cognitive
          ability. EQ tells us how a person deals with their emotions and how
          well they interact on a social level. IQ on other hand gives us
          information about memory, and reasoning of a person and how well they
          process information. Overall both effect different components of a
          person's life. EQ effects motivation, empathy, relationships,
          self-awareness, and self-control, on the other hand IQ effects
          academics, expertise, critical thinking, and logic.
        </p>
        <p class="question">Why is EQ important?</p>
        <p>
          I, including many other people believe that a person with high
          emotional intelligence is more likely to be successful in their life.
          The reason being that they have more control over their emotions, so
          they tend to make good decisions when challenged with difficult
          situations. They are also very good socially, which makes easier for
          them to make new friends and connections. This makes them more
          attractive to potential customers, investors, or employers. Finally, I
          also believe that a high EQ person is happier than an average person
          in their life.

      <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
      <h2>This details my learning plan for my coding journey</h2>
      <h3>19 January 2024</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="question">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to become a full stack developer and then
          eventually try to set up a business of my own.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </p>
        <p>
          My strength in terms of learning is that I am able to understand
          subjects that require analytic thinking and I am able to spend lot of
          time on a particular subject to understand it. My limitation is that
          sometimes I get too involved with a particular subject and I spend too
          much time delving deep into it. Due this I am not able to finish my
          task within a defined period.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?.
        </p>
        <p>
          The skill that I need to develop most in myself is my communication
          skill. I am not comfortable working with too many people. I wish to
          improve that aspect of my core nature.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
          This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
          work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
          industry/community representatives What you will do when things are
          building up and starting to get to you
        </p>
        <p>
          The key to manage the workload in this programme is to have proper
          planning and Time management. You need to keep calm and reassure
          yourself when things aren't going according to plan. Also ask for help
          if you are stuck while being respectful towards everyone.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever I am stuck on any problem, I will try solving it on my own.
          If I am stuck on it for more than an hour, I will reach out to my
          facilitator and ask for help.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
        </p>
        <p>
          I expect the facilitation team to be clear while explaining difficult
          concepts. I also expect them to be respect and friendly towards
          everyone and hope they dont get frustrated easily.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a baby girl at home and she is 18 months old. The only
          commitments I would have is if she needs my time for something
          important. Right now I have planned my schedule around taking care of
          her.

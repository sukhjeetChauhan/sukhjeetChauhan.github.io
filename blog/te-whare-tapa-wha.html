        <h2>What is Te Whare Tapa Whā ?</h2>
        <p>
          Te whare tapa whā is a model of the 4 dimensions of wellbeing
          developed by Sir Mason Durie in 1984 to provide a Māori perspective on
          health. The 4 dimensions are:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-style">
          <li>taha tinana (physical wellbeing)</li>
          <li>taha hinengaro (mental wellbeing)</li>
          <li>taha wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</li>
          <li>taha whānau (family wellbeing)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We are going to develop a personal well-being plan using this model.

        <p class="question">Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing)</p>
        <p>
          Physical well-being is really important for every aspect of life. A
          healthy body leads to a healthy mind. To keep myself physically fit, I
          will focus on eating a healthy and nutrient rich diet. Also, I will
          try to workout atleast 3 times a week. A workout can be anything from
          a small 15 min run or a body weight exercise set.
        </p>
        <p class="question">Taha Hinengaro (mental wellbeing)</p>
        <p>
          As mentioned before, physical well-being plays a major role in mental
          well-being of an individual. So, the number 1 thing anyone could do
          for their mental well-being is exercise. Additionally, meditation
          helps overcome lot of stress of day to day life. I would take atleast
          15 mins every day for deep meditation.
        </p>
        <p class="question">Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</p>
        <p>
          For me, spirituality means to be in harmony with my core-self. I think
          to achieve this goal, it would take a journey of a lifetime. It
          requires self analyzing every day where I am lagging behind and what
          can be done to self correct. Different meditation techniques and
          mindfulness practices can help in this. Also, I believe being true to
          your moral values is really important.
        </p>
        <p class="question">Taha Whānau (family wellbeing)</p>
        <p>
          I consider myself as a family man. For me family is the most important
          thing of a person. To maintain my family well-being, I would try to
          spend more time on weekends with my family. I have a 18 months old
          baby girl. I would try to spend as much time as I can with her.
          Lately, I haven't been able to connect much with my friends who live
          overseas. I will try to be in their contact more often and give them
          call atleast once a month.

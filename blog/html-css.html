          CSS positioning properties are used to move elements around on an HTML
          page. Elements exist in form of a block of pixels, which occupy a
          certain height and a width. By default, the Position of all the
          elements on the page is
          <span class="italics">Static</span>. Static position means elements follow the normal
          flow of an HTML page. We can change the position attribute to any of
          the following:
        </p>
            <ul class="list-style">
            <li>Relative</li>
            <li>Absolute</li>
            <li>Fixed</li>
            <li>Sticky</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          We will be discussing first three position attributes in this blog. If
          you want more information on the sticky property, then visit this
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position"

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Lets take an example as illustrated in Images 1.1 and 1.2. We have a
          parent and a sibling element. Within the parent container there are
          three child elements. The child elements are in brown, bisque and
          green color. The sibling element is in purple color. All the elements
          are in their default positions.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container box-2">
          <div class="image-box ">
            <img
              src="/images/html-css-blog/codesnap/html.png"
              alt="HTML setup"
            />
            <img
              src="/images/html-css-blog/codesnap/page-setup.png"
              alt="CSS properties"
            />
          </div>
          <p>Image 1.2</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="margin-top-10">Relative positioning</h2>
        <p>
          By setting the position to relative, an element offsets itself from
          its static position. The flow of the HTML is not effected by this
          setting, which means that element keeps its block of space on the
          page. Another important thing is that the element only offsets from
          its position if any of the top, bottom, left and right property has
          any value set to it. Otherwise it just behaves like a normal static
          element.
        </p>
        <p>Lets have a look at illustration 2.1 below.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <div class="image-box">
            <img
              src="/images/html-css-blog/codesnap/child-2.png"
              alt="HTML setup"
            />
            <img
              src="/images/html-css-blog/chrome-screenshots/relative-child.png"
              alt="CSS properties"
            />
          </div>
          <p>Image 2.1</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Here the second child with bisque color position is set to relative
          and its position is offset from its original position by 40px from top
          and 40px from left. Notice how the other child elements are still in
          their original positions. That shows that this property doesnot effect
          normal flow of the HTML page.
        </p>
        <h2 class="margin-top-10">Absolute positioning</h2>
        <p>
          Here is when things start getting bit tricky. When you set a position
          of the element to absolute, its position will depend on whether its
          parent element has absolute or relative position set to it or not. The
          object will move out of the normal flow of HTML page, thus effecting
          position of the surrounding elements. The images 3.1 and 3.2 shows the
          difference in absolute positioning with parents element set to
          relative and without parent element set to relative. Also, you can
          notice that distance between child 1 and child 3 has decreased because
          child 2 has moved out of the HTML page flow.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <div class="image-box">
            <img
              src="/images/html-css-blog/codesnap/pos-absolute.png"
              alt="HTML setup"

            <img

              alt="CSS properties"
            />
          </div>
          <p>Image 3.1</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-container">
          <div class="image-box">
            <img
              src="/images/html-css-blog/codesnap/parent.png"
              alt="code for absolute position"
            />
            <img
              src="/images/html-css-blog/chrome-screenshots/absolute-with-relpos.png"
              alt="bisque block absolute positioned within the parent element"
            />
          </div>
          <p>Image 3.2</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          As you can see when the position of parent element is set to relative,
          the child element with absolute positioning align itself according to
          the position of the parent. When the position of parent element is
          static, the child element align itself according to the viewport as
          seen in image 3.1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further we can have a look at what happens to the element with no
          parent element as seen with the sibling element( purple block). As
          seen in the Image 3.3, the element always absolutely positions itself
          according to the viewport.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <div class="image-box">
            <img
              src="/images/html-css-blog/codesnap/sibling-absolute.png"
              alt="code for sibling element"
            />
            <img
              src="/images/html-css-blog/chrome-screenshots/absolute-sibling.png"
              alt="purple block absolute positioned"
            />

          <p>Image 3.3</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="margin-top-10">Fixed positioning</h2>
        <p>
          When an object is set to fixed position, in most of the cases the
          object positions itselfs according to the viewport dimensions. There
          is an exception to this which we will discuss later on in this blog.
          Also, the object moves out of the normal flow of the page, so
          surrounding elements position is also effected by it. Looking at Image
          4.1, we can see that child 1 (brown block) has its position set to
          fixed. As we scroll down on the page, we can see in image 4.2 that the
          fixed positioned block has moved out of its parent container and is
          still positioned according to the viewport.

        </div>
        <h2 class="margin-top-10">Exception to Fixed positioning</h2>
        <p>
          Most of the times when an object's position is fixed it align itself
          according to the viewport. There is an exception to this rule. This
          happens when the parent element has one of the following properties defined in its
          CSS rules set. These properties are:
          <ul class="list-style">
            <li>Transform</li>
            <li>Perspective</li>
            <li>Filter</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Image 4.3 shows what happens when child element has fixed position and parent element has transform property defined.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <div class="image-box">
            <img
              src="/images/html-css-blog/codesnap/exception-fixed.png"
              alt="transform property on parent element"
            />
            <img
              src="/images/html-css-blog/chrome-screenshots/exception-fixed.png"
              alt="child object stays within parent block"
            />
          </div>
          <p>Image 4.3</p>
        </div>
        <p>As you can see, now the child element is positioning itself according to the parent element, not the viewport.</p>
        <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>There are lot of differences between relative, absolute and fixed positioning. Some are subtle differences and some clearcut. These properties are very helpful in aligning objects onto an HTML page. They need to be used wisely, keeping in mind that other elements' positions are not effected by using them.</p>

      <h1>JS Fundamentals</h1>
      <h2>Javascript basics for beginners</h2>
      <h3>25 January 2024</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Javascript, HTML, and CSS coexist with each other in a symbiotic
          relationship. One cannot survive without the other.
        </p>
        <p class="italics">
          Let me explain this relationship in easy to understand terms with help
          of an example.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lets imagine a really beautiful and well built car like this Shelby
          GT500CR
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <div class="image-box">
            <img
              src="/images/javascript-blog/shelby GT500CR (2020).jpg"
              alt="image of a car"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>This represents a beautifully built web page.</p>
        <p>
          Now, as we all know that a car is made of lots of different parts.
          <span class="italics">HTML</span> will represent the raw material to
          build the car like the steel body, chassis and glass used for the
          windows. The <span class="italics">CSS</span> will represent the look
          of the car i.e its color, shape, dimensions etc. The car with its
          shiny looks wont run if it doesnt have a engine or steering and
          controls in it. It will just be parked at a showroom. Thus, the word
          static is used to define a webpage with no javascript in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To move the car, you have to put engine in it and add steering and
          other controls to it. This is similar to what
          <span class="italics">Javascript</span> does. With help of javascript
          you can change the elements on a webpage however you want, making the
          page dynamic.
        </p>
        <h2>Control Flow</h2>
        <p>
          Control Flow is the order in which the program code statements are
          being executed. Control flow plays important part in the desired
          outcome of the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking example of the car above again, control flow would be direction
          towards which car is being driven, at what gear is it being driven. It
          can go forward or reverse. All this can be controlled from inside the
          car. Similarily javascript provides us with few tools to control the
          flow of the program. Some of these tools are Loops, conditional
          statements and functions.
        </p>
        <h2>Loops</h2>
        <p>
          As explained above loops are very important part of programming
          languages. Loops are used to control the flow of the code where you
          need a particular task to be done repetitively. For example, with the
          car above, when it is raining we need the wipers to run again and
          again in the same pattern until the rain stops. Imagine if we had to
          do it manually, it would be literally impossible. Loops help us in
          doing these kind of repetitive tasks. It can be better explained with
          the help of code example below.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <div class="image-box">
            <img
              src="/images/html-css-blog/codesnap/forLoop.png"
              alt="for Loop"
            />
            <img
              src="/images/javascript-blog/console.png"
              alt="console.log of for Loop"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Here you can see that we looped 5 times and with each iteration we
          increased the counter and displayed it in the console.
        </p>
        <h2>DOM</h2>
        <p>
          DOM is short for Document Object Model. It represents the structure of
          a webpage that can be used to manipulate the page. DOM thinks of
          webpage as a combination of nodes and objects. These nodes and objects
          can be accessed through javascript and modifid as needed.
        </p>
        <img
          class="float"
          src="../images/javascript-blog/DOMcode.png"
          style="width: 50%"
        />
        <p>
          If we look at image on the right we can see that DOM manipulation is
          being done in this code to change the background color of the page.
          DOM has various different ways to access the HTML page or document. We
          use the notation "document." to access all the objects of the
          document. Here we used the command "document.querySelector". We can
          also use "document.GetElementByID" or
          "document.GetElementsByClassName" to access the objects by their Id or
          Class Names. There are several other methods as well which we will not
          discuss in this article. If you are curious you can visit this
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_object_model/Locating_DOM_elements_using_selectors"
            class="italics"
            >mdn Page</a

          on DOM manipulation.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <div class="image-box">
            <img
              src="/images/javascript-blog/beforeDOM.png"
              alt="Image of a page before DOM manipulation"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="image-container">
          <div class="image-box">
            <img
              src="/images/javascript-blog/DOMmanipulation.png"
              alt="Image of a page after DOM manipulation"
            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Here you can see we manipulated DOM and changed the color of "h1"
          element to red
        </p>
        <h2>Arrays and Objects</h2>
        <p>
          Arrays and Objects are two diferent ways of storing values in
          Javascript. Actually Arrays are also a sub-category of objects. The
          difference in both of them is that in Arrays, we can access values
          based on their index number while in Objects, we can access values on
          basis of their named index.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use Arrays when we have collection of values that has something in
          common. We can put these values together in a single container.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example we have collection of fruits. We can make a array called
          fruits and put all the values in a single array. We can access these
          values by calling their index number.
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <h3>Array example</h3>
          <p>let fruits = [ 'apple', 'banana', 'oranges', 'peaches' ]</p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
          <h3>How to access the values in array</h3>
          <p>fruit[0] = apple</p>
          <p>fruit[2] = orange</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          On the other hand, Objects are used mainly when we have a collection
          of different items, which are somehow related to each other. We can
          then access these stored values with help of their named keys.
        </p>
        <p>
          In example below, we are making an object 'car' with name keys of
          'type', 'model' and 'color'. We can use two different methods to
          access values in the object. A dot notation and bracket notation.
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <h3>Object example</h3>
          <p>const car = {</p>
          <p class="padding-left">type:"Ford",</p>

          <p class="padding-left">model:"Shelby GT500CR",</p>

          <p class="padding-left">color:"black"</p>
          <p class="padding-left">};</p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
          <h3>How to access the values in array</h3>
          <p>car.type = Ford</p>
          <p>car[type] = Ford</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>
          In programming, a function is like a mini-program within a larger
          program. It does a specific job and can be used over and over.
          Functions are helpful in many different ways.
        </p>
        <img
          class="float"
          src="../images/javascript-blog/functions.png"
          alt="function image"
          style="width: 45%"
        />
        <ul class="list-style">
          <li>
            They break down big problems into smaller, more manageable tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you write a function, you can use it again without rewriting
            the same code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Functions make code easier to understand by grouping related tasks
            together.
          </li>
          <li>
            They hide the details of how something works, showing only what's
            necessary.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In example above we have a function called 'add', which does sum of
          any two numbers. After declaring the function we have to call the
          function to make it work. A function can be declared with a set of
          parameters or without any paramenters. In function above, it takes two
          numbers as its parameters and add them together. We can see we called
          the function with <span class="italics">add(2,3)</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, functions make coding more organized, reusable, and
          understandable. They're like building blocks that contribute to
          better, more efficient programs.

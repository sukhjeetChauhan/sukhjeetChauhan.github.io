        <p class="question">
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </p>
        <p>
          Some new things that I learned about myself is that I have a fixed
          mindset and I need to inculcate more of a growth mindset into my
          thinking. Also, I learnt that I can be sometimes too quick to judge
          people and I need to be more open to understanding peoples
          circumstances. Third thing that I learned is that I need to work more
          on my communication skills.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </p>
        <p>
          Values, empathy, and self awareness are very important qualities to
          possess while working together as a team. To become a good programmer
          you need to be good person first and be aware of your shortcomings.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </p>
        <p>
          The one surprising thing that I found about core is that how hard it
          is to search your inner self and really try to understand your true
          self.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </p>

        <p>
          As described above, trying to analyze your self and searching for
          answers while being completely truthful about it was really hard for
          me.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </p>
        <p>
          At dev academy special focus is laid on core values because dev
          academy is on a mission to transform its students into good human
          beings first and then into good developers. Also, this makes you into
          a more hirable person.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be truthful about it, it does feel like we are wasting time on it
          sometimes but then I also understand the true importance of it and
          feel like it is necessary to do this.
